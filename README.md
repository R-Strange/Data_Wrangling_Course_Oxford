# Wrangling and Pipelines for Data Handling

Problem sheets, solved examples and resources for the Wrangling and Pipelines for Data Handling Course.



### Required Libraries

For the exercises, you will need the following python libraries:

* SciPy stack
* SQLalchemy
* psycopg2
* tweepy

you can install the required libraries through the conda package manager if you are using anaconda, or pip if you are using an different python distribution. *using conda is the recommended approach.*

If you are using the standard Anaconda installation, SciPy will likely come installed by default. Ideally, all problem sheet work will be carried out using iPython/Jupyter notebooks, and all problem sheets and solutions are presented as `.ipynb` files. If you do use a different Python distribution you will need to ensure that you have iPython or Jupyter installed and working.

For anaconda, you can use the following commands to install the required libraries:

```sh
 conda install -c anaconda scipy
 conda install -c conda-forge sqlalchemy
 conda install -c conda-forge psycopg2
 conda install -c conda-forge tweepy
```

If you are using pip, you can use the following commands to install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
pip install SQLalchemy
pip install psycopg2
pip install tweepy
```
