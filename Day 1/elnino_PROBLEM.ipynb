    "# Problem Sheet - 8th April 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pull data from a remote server\n",
    "* Profile the data\n",
    "* Fix any issues that you find\n",
    "* Write the data into a flat file of your your choosing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a dataset of weather reports from buoys in the Pacific showing el nino and la nina effects over a number of years. However, the data is raw, and has not been checked or used yet. The data may be ready to be processed as it is, or there may be issues that need to be resolved before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are happy with the dataset, write it to disk in whichever type of flat file you think suits the data best!\n",
    "\n",
    "The data exists in a Postgres database, in a server in Ireland. You will need to pull it from the database. You have been provided a server details in a seperate file (server_credentials.json).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hints\n",
    "* Remember to describe your findings and discoveries in the markdown (text) cells in notebooks. you can do this by changing the cell value from \"code\" to \"markdown\" in the dorpdown menu in the toolbar or pressing \"m\" while in command mode (your highlighted cell is blue, not green. If it is green, press Esc)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can simply copy-paste your credentials into your notebook. However, if you can access your credentials directly from the other file it is much safer - you can share your notebook without everyone seeing your sign-in details!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember that cells can appear as not null, yet contain no meaningful information!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful code for reading JSONs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"server_credentials.json\", \"r\") as read_file:\n",
    "    credentials = json.load(read_file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And for connecting to the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#to create the URI for connecting. Consider using the .format() function to write in the needed values to the string.... psycopg2 helps manage the formats and protocols behind the scenes for working with a postgres server\n",
    "DATABASE_URI = 'postgres+psycopg2://user:pass@host:port/database'\n",
    "\n",
    "#SQLalchemy is given the URI and opens a connection to the database behind the scenes\n",
    "engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URI)\n",
    "\n",
    "#We try to pull the data table down into a pandas dataframe. we give pandas the details of the DB connection engine it needs to talk to.\n",
    "raw_data_df = pd.read_sql_table(table_name=\"table_name\", con = engine)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And some helpful code for profiling:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "#to count individual cells that are null in a dataframe\n",
    "dataframe.isnull().values.ravel().sum()\n",
    "#to count the number of incomplete (some cells are null) rows in a dataframe\n",
    "sum([True for index,row in dataframe.iterrows() if any(row.isnull())])\n",
    "```"
