    "We want to look at the trends of tweets over the last day. Thankfully, twitter lets us access its data for free. However, to stop people from abusing it, it limits users on their download rates and makes then authenticate themselves when they interact with their servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we will need to let twitter know that we want to access their data through their API (Application Program Interface). Let's access the Twitter Developer website behind twitter here... https://developer.twitter.com and register ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we're in, let's set up a pretend app that we can tie the account to so we can generate our access keys. We will need consumer API keys and secret keys, and Access tokens and access token secrets. If prompted for permissions, we will only be reading, not writing for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about setting up a twitter dev environment or premium APIs - we're not here to buy data and use it in bulk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your tokens, create a JSON file to keep the data in, away from the openly readable code!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Thankfully, we just want to look at public-facing data, like public tweets around a given hashtag, so we only need to authenticate our code's connection to the API.\n",

OAuth2 is the protocol we're using, and it's far easier as we want read-only calls to the servers. *(Every API behaves differently. OAuth1/2 are twitter specific protocols, although many authentication patterns offer different protocols for write or read access, often with token/key authentication)*"
